## Habduino

This is the original code base for Habduino V4.X boards. It is still suitable for flights but is no longer maintained or supported. Hardware definitions are all current. 

This code provides simultaneous (where legal and supported by the hardware installed) transmission of radio telemetry via RTTY and APRS on Habduino Arduino addon boards for High Altitude Ballooning. 

## Move to Flextrack

We strongly recommend you move to Dave Akermans Flextrack as this is updated and maintained. We have forked the Flextrack code here https://github.com/HABduino/FlexTrack and made Habduino specific amendments.

## Disclaimer

The Habduino code is provided as is with no guarantees of performance or operation. 

If you decide to use this code under a balloon it’s your responsibility to ensure you comply with the local legislation and laws regarding meteorological balloon launching and radio transmission in the air. 
The Radiometrix NTX2B 434Mhz is NOT license exempt in the United States of America and does need a radio amateur license.

Use of APRS requires a radio amateur license in all countries and a number of countries don’t permit the airborne use of APRS under any circumstances. 

It is YOUR responsibility to ensure Habduino hardware and code is used safely and legally please review the safety section on the website.
